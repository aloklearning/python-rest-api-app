# Virtal Environment

- This consists of commands to create a virtual environment in case we want to create one.
- In this case we have created one, for installing one library called Flask-RESTful
- Follow this commands and we will be good to good to:
    - Go inside the project, and create one more folder for the virtua environment
    - `pip3 install virtualenv` [For creating a virtual env]
    - `virtualenv venv --python=python3` [Recreating python for the virtualenv without installing Python]
    - `source venv/bin/activate` [For Mac or Linux for activating Virtual Env] 
    - `python --version` [To check which version is there of Python in the virtual env]
    - `deactivate` [To exit the virtual env]

# Flask-RESTful

- Command to install is `pip/pip3 install Flask-RESTful`
- This is a Flask library to easily allow the person to create RESTful APIs

- We can directly install the Flask-RESTful in order to create a project in our main project, but first uninstall Flask, and then install the library
